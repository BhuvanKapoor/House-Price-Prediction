# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the PRODIGY_ML_01 repository! This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Introduction

PRODIGY_ML_01 is a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and condition of the house. This repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.
- Implementation of regression model.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank all the contributors and the open-source community for their support. Special thanks to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for providing the dataset and platform.
